## ðŸ”¬ What is the Ising Model?

The Ising model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical physics. It provides a simplified representation of magnetic materials where atomic spins interact with their neighbors.

### Key Concepts:

- **Spins**: Each lattice site has a discrete spin variable Ïƒáµ¢ âˆˆ {-1, +1} ("down" or "up")
- **Interactions**: Spins interact with their nearest neighbors through exchange coupling J
- **Magnetic Field**: External magnetic field h can influence spin alignment
- **Hamiltonian**: The energy function governing the system:

  <div align="center">
  
  `H = -J âˆ‘âŸ¨ijâŸ© Ïƒáµ¢Ïƒâ±¼ - h âˆ‘áµ¢ Ïƒáµ¢`
  
  </div>

### Physical Significance:
- **Phase Transitions**: Exhibits spontaneous magnetization below critical temperature Têœ€
- **Universality**: Belongs to same universality class as many real physical systems
- **Computational Paradigm**: Foundation for understanding Monte Carlo methods and optimization

### Applications Beyond Physics:
- Neuroscience (neural networks)

- Optimization problems (traveling salesman)
- Machine learning (Boltzmann machines)
- Social sciences (opinion dynamics)
